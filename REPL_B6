# REPL_B6
1. Initialize replication on both sites

2. Update replv2 some parameters on primary site.
> run acfsutil repl update {-s user@netname ] [-d level] [{-C | -i period}] [-z { on | off }] mountp
3.  Check updated info by "repl info -c"  on  primary site

5. Check updated info by "repl info -c"  on standby
> As in original replication, the commands must be run as ‘root’.
